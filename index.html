        <div class="para">
            We are here to help you get started in your programming journery.
            We are self taught programmers that simply means the programming languages
            that we would try to teach, we learnt by ourselves and we know how is it like
            to start learning a new programming language and now we want to make this process 
            easier for as many people as possible.

            Now you must be wondering why would you want to learn from us and not some proffesional. 
            Well you're not completely wrong about that.
            Now assume that you are in school, wait let us clear this for you first maybe you are in school 
            but keep that in mind but it's not necessary for you to be a school/college student to start learning 
            programming or coding as a matter of fact you dont even need to have any degree to be able to learn 
            and get a job as a programmer all you need is willingness to learn.
            Okay coming back to why you should learn from us, as I said imagine you're in school and you didn't
            understood the topic your teacher just taught, you would most probably ask your friend if they can help
            you understand the topic and when your friend teaches you the same topic you just get it without any problem.
            Now does that mean your friend is smarter than your teacher, well no it's just that he understands you better 
            than your teacher.
            Now back to us, we are your friend here who are trying to teach you something that we understood and now
            you want to learn. So believe us when we say that we can understand you better than any other proffesionalcan.
            still have any doubts feel free to <a href="https://mailchi.mp/a04e1db806b1/contact-us" style="text-decoration: underline;">contact us</a>
